# 🎮 PUBG Game Outcome Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **final placement of players in a PUBG match** using machine learning regression techniques. It analyzes player statistics such as kills, damage dealt, distance walked, and more to estimate their final match rank.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a regression model that can accurately **predict the winPlacePerc** (final player rank percentage) using in-game performance features.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains player match stats from PUBG. Some of the features include:
- `kills`
- `damageDealt`
- `walkDistance`
- `boosts`
- `heals`
- `killPlace`
- ...and more

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Selection & Engineering
- Linear Regression Modeling
- Model Evaluation (R² score, MAE)

---

## 🛠️ Libraries & Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Results

- The Linear Regression model was able to predict the player's final placement with decent accuracy.
- Insights were drawn on which features most impact the result, such as walk distance and damage dealt.
